HW6 Questions:
- Events log/string in ShapesList?
  - Should ShapesList keep track of events or should the Shape itself keep track?
- Check if shape is already moving- model or controller?
- Need to make Square/Circle classes now?
  - Not for part 1.
- What ways should we be checking for equality?
- How many constructors?
- Coordinate boundaries (for the shapes)- model or view (separation of concerns)?


NOTES: 
- we're gonna need a removeShape method that we can call at disappear time
