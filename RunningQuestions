HW6 Questions:
- Events log/string in ShapesList?
  - Should ShapesList keep track of events or should the Shape itself keep track?
  - List(string) in ShapesList to track events.
- Check if shape is already moving- model or controller?
- Need to make Square/Circle classes now?
  - Not for part 1.
- What ways should we be checking for equality?
- How many constructors?
- Coordinate boundaries (for the shapes)- model or view (separation of concerns)?
- Invalid scalar?
- Does the time frame for move, scale, change color mean that the shape reverts after the end time or that's just how long the event takes?


NOTES: 
- we're gonna need a removeShape method that we can call at disappear time
