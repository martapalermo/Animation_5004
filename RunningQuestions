HW6 Questions:
- Events log/string in ShapesList?
  - Should ShapesList keep track of events or should the Shape itself keep track?
- Need to make Square/Circle classes now?
 - Not for part 1.
- What ways should we be checking for equality?
- How many constructors?
- Coordinate boundaries (for the shapes)- model or view (separation of concerns)?
