Running Question for the View: 

- In 1.3 - "if objects overlap during animation" does it refer to physical overlapping or is it timed events happening at the same time? 
- Do we need to make these animation run in a loop? or is this going to be timer-based? 

- Animation Building: is this our appendable?   

Where does this go??
- Implement a factory of views, with a single static method that takes in a String name 
for a view—“text”, “svg”, or “visual”— and constructs an instance of the appropriate concrete view.

- Is zero speed just static (not moving) ?

JAR??
